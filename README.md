👋 Hello, I'm Emir
 I have B1 level knowledge of English and A1.2 level knowledge of German. 
**16-Year-Old Cybersecurity & Software Development Enthusiast | Student | Open to Opportunities**

I'm a passionate and driven student diving deep into the world of cybersecurity and software development. I believe in learning by doing and building tools to understand how technology works from the ground up.
🔐 My Focus & Ethos

My primary interest lies in cybersecurity—understanding threats, defenses, and the principles of secure systems. I complement this with software development skills to create, analyze, and automate.

A core principle of my work:

    All projects and tools I develop and share are strictly for educational and research purposes. They are created to learn, experiment in safe environments, and understand technical concepts. I strongly advocate for ethical, legal, and responsible use of technology. Any tool in my repositories is intended to strengthen knowledge in defensive security, penetration testing (in authorized contexts), and system analysis.

🛠️ Technical Skills & Tools

I'm actively building my skills in the following areas:

    Cybersecurity Fundamentals: Network security, vulnerability analysis, ethical hacking principles.

    Programming & Scripting: Python, Bash, php, JavaScript, C++.

    Tools & Platforms: Familiarity with tools like Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit (for educational labs), Git, Linux command line.

    Concepts: Operating systems, networking (TCP/IP), basic cryptography, problem-solving.

🚀 What I Bring to the Table

    Fast Learner & Adaptable: At 16, I'm immersed in a learning mindset, quickly grasping new concepts and technologies.

    Self-Motivated & Proactive: I undertake personal projects beyond school curriculum to challenge myself.

    Detail-Oriented & Analytical: Crucial for spotting vulnerabilities and writing clean, functional code.

    Strong Work Ethic: I am dedicated, persistent, and take pride in completing what I start.

📂 My Projects

Here, you'll find my learning journey materialized. Each repository includes:
- A clear educational purpose.
- Detailed documentation and comments.
- A responsible Disclaimer.

    Developing IP address finding and querying, basic 64-based encryption, and many penetration testing tools, but all of course for educational purposes.

📫 Let's Connect & Opportunities

I am eager to learn, contribute, and grow. I am actively seeking:

    Internships or apprenticeship-style opportunities in cybersecurity or software development.

    Collaboration on open-source or educational projects.

    Guidance, mentorship, and constructive feedback from professionals in the field.

    Networking with other students and developers.

I am officially open to job offers and professional opportunities that match my skill level and allow me to learn in a real-world environment.
